# bun-monorepo-template

A modern type-safe multi-platform performant stack

## The Stack

- **Bun** (Runtime, workspace and package management)
- **TypeScript** (because JavaScript is illegal at this point)
- **tRPC** (for end-to-end type-safe APIs)
- **Prisma** (type-safe database communication)
- **React Native** (write once, export to Android and iOS... *launch your MVP ASAP*)
- **NextJS or React** (depends if you want SEO or not)
- **TamagUI** (write UI once, export to **Web** & **React Native**)
- **Legend** (observable-based state management === minimal re-rendering)
